# I've joined the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge

#### Start Date
February 19th, 2019

This is a repository for all my 100 days of ML code challenges. During these 100 days, I will be spending at least 1 hour every day to learn about machine learning and Data Science. I also intend to code and blog my progress as I develop my skills.
